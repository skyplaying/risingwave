Because currently the e2e test for `generate_series(..., now(), ...)` relies on external command `./risedev psql`, it cannot be tested in parallel, madsim and single-node mode. Let's just place it in this special folder and manually run it in `run-e2e-test.sh` to avoid complexity. Later if we introduce a new `now()`-like function that returns the time of statement execution, we'll be able to get rid of the external command and direcly create MV instead. We will move this to `streaming` folder at that time.
